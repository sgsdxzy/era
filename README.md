# Era

Era is a fast, cheap, simple, robust 3d printer design.

This project is greatly inspired by [Ultimaker 2 Aluminum Extrusion 3D printer](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:811271).
All parts are drawn in OpenSCAD for ease of modification. All M3 nuts are changed to more common M4 nuts.

## Design Objectives

### How fast

We desgin for a minimum of 200mm/s. 400mm/s is possible.

### How cheap

It should cost around 1200-1400 CNY If you live in China and buy all parts online.

### How simple

We use a minimum number of printed/non-standard parts in favor of standard parts.

### How robust

It should run 7/24 if you give a good supply of filament and power.
